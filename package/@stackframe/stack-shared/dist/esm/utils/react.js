      ${options.caller ?? "This code path"} attempted to display a loading indicator, but didn't find a Suspense boundary above it. Please read the error message below carefully.

      The fix depends on which of the 3 scenarios caused it:

      1. You are missing a loading.tsx file in your app directory. Fix it by adding a loading.tsx file in your app directory.

      2. The component is rendered in the root (outermost) layout.tsx or template.tsx file. Next.js does not wrap those files in a Suspense boundary, even if there is a loading.tsx file in the same folder. To fix it, wrap your layout inside a route group like this:

        - app
        - - layout.tsx  // contains <html> and <body>, alongside providers and other components that don't need ${options.caller ?? "this code path"}
        - - loading.tsx  // required for suspense
        - - (main)
        - - - layout.tsx  // contains the main layout of your app, like a sidebar or a header, and can use ${options.caller ?? "this code path"}
        - - - route.tsx  // your actual main page
        - - - the rest of your app

        For more information on this approach, see Next's documentation on route groups: https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/route-groups

      3. You caught this error with try-catch or a custom error boundary. Fix this by rethrowing the error or not catching it in the first place.
